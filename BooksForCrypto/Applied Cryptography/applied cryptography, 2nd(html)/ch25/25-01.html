<P>The NSA is the National Security Agency (once called &#147;No Such Agency&#148; or &#147;Never Say Anything,&#148; but they&#146;ve been more open recently), the official security body of the U.S. government. President Harry Truman created the agency in 1952 under the Department of Defense, and for many years its very existence was kept secret. The NSA is concerned with signals intelligence; its mandate is to listen in on and decode all foreign communications of interest to the security of the United States.
</P>
<P>The following paragraphs are excerpted from NSA&#146;s original charter, signed by President Truman in 1952, and classified for many years thereafter [1535]:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>The COMINT mission of the National Security Agency (NSA) shall be to provide an effective, unified organization and control of the communications intelligence activities of the United States conducted against foreign governments, to provide for integrated operational policies and procedures pertaining thereto. As used in this directive, the terms &#147;communications intelligence&#148; or &#147;COMINT&#148; shall be construed to mean all procedures and methods used in the interception of communications other than foreign press and propaganda broadcasts and the obtaining of information from such communications by other than intended recipients, but shall exclude censorship and the production and dissemination of finished intelligence.
</P>
<P>The special nature of COMINT actives requires that they be treated in all respects as being outside the framework of other or general intelligence activities. Orders, directives, policies, or recommendations of any authority of the Executive Branch relating to the collection, production, security, handling, dissemination, or utilization of intelligence, and/or classified material, shall not be applicable to COMINT actives, unless specifically so stated and issued by competent department or agency authority represented on the Board. Other National Security Council Intelligence Directives to the Director of Central Intelligence and related implementing directives issued by the Director of Central Intelligence shall be construed as non-applicable to COMINT activities, unless the National Security Council has made its directive specifically applicable to COMINT.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>NSA conducts research in cryptology, both in designing secure algorithms to protect U.S. communications and in designing cryptanalytic techniques to listen in on non-U.S. communications. The NSA is known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world; it is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the world. The NSA probably possesses cryptographic expertise many years ahead of the public state of the art (in algorithms, but probably not in protocols) and can undoubtedly break many of the systems used in practice. But, for reasons of national security, almost all information about the NSA&#151;even its budget&#151;is classified. (Its budget is rumored to be $13 billion per year&#151;including military funding of NSA projects and personnel&#151;and it is rumored to employ 16,000 people.)
</P>
<P>The NSA uses its power to restrict the public availability of cryptography, so as to prevent national enemies from employing encryption methods too strong for the NSA to break. James Massey discusses this struggle between academic and military research in cryptography [1007]:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>If one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government, one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted behind closed doors. Without doubt, the number of workers engaged today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of those engaged in open research in cryptology. For only about 10 years has there in fact been widespread open research in cryptology. There have been, and will continue to be, conflicts between these two research communities. Open research is a common quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in scholarly journals. But can a government agency, charged with responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations, countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break? Can a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might undermine the effectiveness of his own government&#146;s code-breakers? One might argue that publication of a provably secure cipher would force all governments to behave like Stimson&#146;s &#147;gentlemen,&#148; but one must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with political and ethical considerations of a severity more than in most scientific fields. The wonder is not that some conflicts have occurred between government agencies and open researchers in cryptology, but rather that these conflicts (at least those of which we are aware) have been so few and so mild.

</BLOCKQUOTE><P>James Bamford wrote a fascinating book about the NSA: <I>The Puzzle Palace</I> [79], recently updated by Bamford and Wayne Madsen [80].</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><I>The Commercial COMSEC Endorsement Program (CCEP)</I></B></FONT></P>
<P>The Commercial COMSEC Endorsement Program (CCEP), codenamed Overtake, is a 1984 NSA initiative to facilitate the development of computer and communications products with embedded cryptography [85,1165]. The military had always paid for this kind of thing for themselves, and it was very expensive. The NSA figured that if companies could sell equipment to both the military and to corporate users, even overseas, costs would go down and everyone would benefit. They would no longer endorse equipment as complying with Federal Standard 1027, and then CCEP would provide government-endorsed cryptographic equipment [419].
</P>
<P>NSA developed a series of cryptographic modules for different purposes. Different algorithms would be used in the modules for different applications, and manufacturers would be able to pull one module out and plug in another depending on the customer. There were modules for military use (Type I), modules for &#147;unclassified but sensitive&#148; government use (Type II), modules for corporate use (Type III), and modules for export (Type IV). Table 25.1 summarizes the different modules, applications, and names.</P>
<P>This program is still around, but never became popular outside the government. All the modules were tamperproof, all the algorithms were classified, and you had to get your keys from NSA. Corporations never really bought into the idea of using classified algorithms dictated by the government. You&#146;d think the NSA would have learned from this lesson and not even bothered with Clipper, Skipjack, and escrowed encryption chips.</P><P><BR></P>
