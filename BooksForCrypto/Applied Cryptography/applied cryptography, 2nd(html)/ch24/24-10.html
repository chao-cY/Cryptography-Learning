<P>Smart cards can have different cryptographic protocols and algorithms programmed into them. They might be configured as an electronic purse, and be able to spend and receive digital cash. They may be able to perform zero-knowledge authentication protocols; they may have their own encryption keys. They might be able to sign documents, or unlock applications on a computer.
</P>
<P>Some smart cards are assumed to be tamperproof; this often protects the institution that issues the cards. A bank wouldn&#146;t want you to be able to hack their smart card to give yourself more money.</P>
<P>There is a lot of interest in smart cards, and a lot of information about them is available. A good survey article on the cryptography in smart cards is [672]. CARTES is a conference held in Paris every October; and CardTech is held in Washington, D.C. every April. The proceedings of two other smart-card conferences are [342, 382]. There are hundreds of smart-card patents, mostly owned by European companies. An interesting paper on possible future applications&#151;integrity checking, audit trails, copy protection, digital cash, secure postage meters&#151;is [1628].</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading15"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">24.14 Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS)</FONT></H3>
<P>The Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) are RSA Data Security, Inc.&#146;s attempt to provide an industry standard interface for public-key cryptography. Traditionally, this sort of thing would be handled by ANSI, but, considering the current situation in cryptography politics, RSADSI figured that they had better do it on their own. Working with a variety of companies, they developed a series of standards. Some are compatible with other standards and some are not.
</P>
<P>These are not standards in the traditional sense of the word; no standards body convened and voted on PKCS. According to its own materials, RSADSI will &#147;retain sole decision-making authority on what each standard is&#148; and will &#147;publish revised standards when appropriate&#148; [803].</P>
<P>Even so, there is a lot of good stuff here. If you&#146;re not sure what kind of syntax and data structures to use when programming public-key cryptography, these standards are probably as good as anything else you can come up with. And, since they&#146;re not really standards, you can tailor them to suit your needs.</P>
<P>Following is a short description of each PKCS (PKCS #2 and PKCS #4 have been incorporated into PKCS #1).</P>
<P>PKCS #1 [1345] describes a method for RSA encryption and decryption, primarily for constructing the digital signatures and digital envelopes described in PKCS #7. For digital signatures, the message is hashed and then the hash is encrypted with the private key of the signer. Both message and hash are represented together as detailed in PKCS #7. For digital envelopes (encrypted messages), the message is first encrypted with a symmetric algorithm, and then the message key is encrypted with the public key of the recipient. The encrypted message and encrypted key are represented together according to the syntax of PKCS #7. Both of these methods are compatible with PEM standards. PKCS #1 also describes a syntax, identical to the syntax in X.509 and PEM, for RSA public and private keys and three signature algorithms&#151;MD2 and RSA, MD4 and RSA, and MD5 and RSA&#151;for signing certificates and the like.</P>
<P>PKCS #3 [1346] describes a method for implementing Diffie-Hellman key exchange.</P>
<P>PKCS #5 [1347] describes a method for encrypting messages with a secret key derived from a password. It uses either MD2 or MD5 to derive the key from the password, and encrypts with DES in CBC mode. The method is intended primarily to encrypt private keys when transferring them from one computer system to another, but can be used to encrypt messages.</P>
<P>PKCS #6 [1348] describes a standard syntax for public key certificates. The syntax is a superset of an X.509 certificate, so that X.509 certificates can be extracted if necessary. Over and above the X.509 set, additional attributes extend the certification process beyond just the public key. These include other information, such as electronic mail address.</P>
<P>PKCS # 7 [1349] is a general syntax for data that may be encrypted or signed, such as digital envelopes or digital signatures. The syntax is recursive, so that envelopes can be nested, or someone can sign some previously encrypted data. The syntax also allows other attributes, such as timestamps, to be authenticated along with the message content. PKCS #7 is compatible with PEM so that signed and encrypted messages can be converted to PEM messages without any cryptographic operations, and vice versa. PKCS #7 can support a variety of architectures&#151;PEM is one&#151;for certificate-based key management.</P>
<P>PKCS #8 [1350] describes a syntax for private key information&#151;including a private key and a set of attributes&#151;and a syntax for encrypted private keys. PKCS #5 can be used to encrypt the private key information.</P>
<P>PKCS #9 [1351] defines selected attribute types for PKCS #6 extended certificates, PKCS #7 digitally signed messages, and PKCS #8 private-key information.</P>
<P>PKCS #10 [1352] describes a standard syntax for certification requests. A certification comprises a distinguished name, a public key, and (optionally) a set of attributes, collectively signed by the person requesting certification. Certification requests are sent to a certification authority, who either transforms the request into an X.509 public-key certificate or a PKCS #6 certificate.</P>
<P>PKCS #11 [1353], the Cryptographic Token API Standard, specifies a programming interface called &#147;Cryptoki&#148; for portable cryptographic devices of all kinds. Cryptoki presents a common logical model, enabling applications to perform cryptographic operations on portable devices without knowing details of the underlying technology. The standard also defines application profiles: sets of algorithms that a device may support.</P>
<P>PKCS #12 [1354] describes syntax for storing in software a user&#146;s public keys, protected private keys, certificates, and other related cryptographic information. The goal is to standardize on a single key file for use among a variety of applications.</P>
<P>These standards are comprehensive, but not exhaustive. Many things are outside their scope: the problem of naming, noncryptographic issues surrounding certification, key lengths, and conditions on various parameters. What the PKCS provide are a format for transferring data based on public-key cryptography and an infrastructure to support that transfer.</P><P><BR></P>
